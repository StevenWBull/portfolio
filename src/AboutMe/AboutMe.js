                <p>
                  I am a current apprentice for Thinkful in the Engineering Immersion program.
                  I love the smell of strong coffee in front of a computer monitor in the morning,
                  and I love solving problems and squashing bugs even more.
                  The endorphin rush I experience whenever I finally publish a project can rival any adrenaline junkie’s high.
                  I enjoy learning new things and breaking everything while putting those new things into practice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I’m not in front of a computer monitor, I can be found spending time 
                  with my wife and three (large) dogs or binge-watching various types of 
                  documentaries on Netflix. 
                  My current one-year learning goals (beyond coding) are the piano and the 
                  Spanish language. Maybe if Spanish were a computer language, 
                  I could learn it quicker than I currently am…
